EffecƟve inventory and sales management are criƟcal for opƟmizing profitability in the retail
and wholesale industry. Companies need to ensure that they are not incurring losses due to
inefficient pricing, poor inventory turnover, or vendor dependency. The goal of this analysis
is to:

 IdenƟfy underperforming brands that require promoƟonal or pricing adjustments.
 Determine top vendors contribuƟng to sales and gross profit.
 Analyze the impact of bulk purchasing on unit costs.
 Assess inventory turnover to reduce holding costs and improve efficiency.
 InvesƟgate the profitability variance between high-performing and low-performing
vendors.
